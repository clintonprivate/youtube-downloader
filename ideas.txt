1. Whisper can get phrase timestamps that are confirmed to be correct, so use that.
2. After getting confirmed phrases, split it into the 5 longest silences for example to get syllables.
3. Increase the low amplitude threshold and maybe work with highest amplitude.

[0, 0.60, 0.72, 0.9, 1.2, 1.4, 2.48, 2.55, 2.67, 2.79, 3.03, 3.15, 3.4, 4.5]
[0, 1.18, 2.1, 2.4, 2.64, 3.1, 3.35, 3.6]
[G4, G4, G4, F#4, e4, a4, e4, e4, e4, e4, e4, e4, b4]

[When you match syllables and low threshold, it is confirmed to end at the right place]
