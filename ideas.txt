All we need is a function that tracks our responses to new onset questions, we can save those only in a file and overwrite when an onset answer has been repeated most often, the less often chosen answer is deleted. It does this until we have reached 99 percent accuracy. The 1800 bare minimum questions. 3600 plus random questions is 100%. After asking you that it says training complete. It has a fixed set of questions it plans to ask you instead of an indefinte amount. So you know when it should be working. We can automatically put in the answer. But how do we know when it's working intuitively. When it splits audio into syllables and all of them sound correct over the span of 5 songs. Success. Truth is that we don't know what amount will get us to that point, but instead once we have reached the amount of estimated examples that we want, we will optimize it such that it only needs that amount to reach the goal.
