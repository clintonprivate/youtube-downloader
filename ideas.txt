Alignment
Audio duration to amount of measures. Is it exact? Then that's not a coincidence. If not, trim front or back to make it exact?
How does chordify align it, does it skip some in the beginning of the video?

- Download specifically colorful blue flame vocals audio.
- Add that same video id to chords in python and java.
- In order to align both, we need to know if anything is being skipped in the beginning or end of the same video. Mostly (likely) the beginning of the video/song.
- Manually check if the position in time of the first chord starts at 0.0 seconds or not. If it doesn't then bring partially skipped in the beginning.
- Already confirmed that this song does start at 0 seconds, so as long as you remove nothing from the beginning during measurement, that part will be correctly aligned. For chords though, well most videos actually already start the music at 0 seconds, so you mostly don't need to do anything extra.
